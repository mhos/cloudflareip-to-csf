This Bash script, created by Casey O'Connor, is designed to automate the daily update of CloudFlare IP lists on a server. It first defines various file paths related to CSF (ConfigServer Security & Firewall), including the paths for csf.allow, csf.ignore, and a custom script for CloudFlare IPs. The script then retrieves the current list of CloudFlare IPv4 and IPv6 addresses using curl, updates the csf/cloudflare.allow file with the new IPs, and checks and modifies the csf.allow and csf.ignore files accordingly. Finally, it restarts CSF/LFD (ConfigServer Firewall and Login Failure Daemon) and creates a cron job in /etc/cron.daily/cloudflareips to automate this process daily. The script ensures that the server's CSF is configured to allow CloudFlare IPs and keeps the configurations up to date.
